	- The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically. If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
      https://github.com/wso2-dev/esb-connectors/tree/master/integration-base
	- A valid AMAZON SES topic needs to be created before running the test suite.
	  Refer : http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/CreateTopic.html
	
    Tested Platforms: 

    - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
    - Ubuntu 13.04
    - WSO2 ESB 4.8.1
 
Steps to follow in setting integration test.
 1.  Download ESB 4.8.1 from official website.
 2.  Deploy relevant patches, if applicable.

STEPS: 
 
 1. Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access AMAZONSES API over https

	i) Extract the certificate from browser by navigating to 'https://email.us-west-2.amazonaws.com' and place the certificate file in following location.
	   "{AMAZONSES_CONNECTOR_HOME}/amazonses-connector/amazonses-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products/"
	  
	ii) Navigate to "{AMAZONSES_CONNECTOR_HOME}/amazonses-connector/amazonses-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import AmazonSES certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from AMAZONSES, change it accordingly. (e.g. -.amazonses.com)
			   CERT_NAME is name of the certificate. (e.g. amazonses)
	   
	iii) Go to new ESB 4.8.1 folder and place the downloaded certificate in "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/"

	iv) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" in command line to import AMAZONSES certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from AmazonSES, change it accordingly. (e.g. -.amazonses.com)
		       CERT_NAME is name of the certificate. (e.g. amazonses)
			   
 2. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-4.8.1.zip and copy that zip file in to location "{AMAZONSES_CONNECTOR_HOME}/amazonses-connector/amazonses-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/repository/".

 3. Create a fresh account in Amazon AWS and Log on to https://aws.amazon.com/ses/ in the web browser.
	i) 	 	On the hompage, under App Service, choose SES.
	ii)  	Click on the dropdown link on the top right tab (which has your account name) on your Amazon SES page and go to 'Security Credentials'.

 4. Update the amazonses properties file at location "{AMAZONSES_CONNECTOR_HOME}/amazonses-connector/amazonses-connector-1.0.0/org.wso2.carbon.connector/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/connector/config" as below.
	
	i) 		apiUrl - Use the API URL as "https://email.us-west-2.amazonaws.com".
	ii) 	accessKeyId - Use the Access Key generated in step 3.
	iii) 	secretAccessKey - Use the Secret Key generated in step 3.
	iv)		identity,emailAddress,deleteIdentity,source - (Single valued) Use email addresses which you added to SES account in step 3 and verified.
	v) 		toAddresses,ccAddresses,bccAddresses,replyToAddresses,destinations,identities(at least two identities NEED to be provided) - (Multi valued) Use email addresses which you added to SES account in step 3 and verified. (Multiple email addresses need to be comma seperated)
